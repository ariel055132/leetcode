# LeetCode Explain Skill
The user provides a leetcode.com URL and asks to understand or solve it.

## Workflow
1. **Fetch the URL** with WebFetch. Never answer from memory alone when a URL is provided.
2. **Extract** the problem statement, examples, and constraints from the page.
3. If the page is gated or partial, extract whatever is available and fall back to recognized-problem knowledge for the rest.

## Output format
Respond in this order:
1. **Problem summary** — 2–4 sentences. Keep it short; the user already linked the problem.
2. **Key insight** — the core idea that makes the solution work.
3. **Step-by-step algorithm** — concrete steps, not vague descriptions.
4. **Worked example** — trace one of the problem's own examples. Prefer a table (index | value | running state | decision).
5. **Implementation** — code in the requested language; default C++.
6. **Complexity** — time and space.

## Response language
Detect the language of the fetched problem body:
- English content (leetcode.com) → respond in English.
- Chinese content (leetcode.cn) → respond in Chinese (中文).
- Mixed or unclear → follow the problem description body.
An explicit user request ("explain in English", "用中文解释") always overrides auto-detection.

## Programming language
- Default to Java when unspecified.
- Honor any explicit request ("in Python", "using Java").
- Do not ask a follow-up question about language — pick the default and proceed.

## Style
- Be concrete. Show the actual state of data structures at each step.
- Prefer tables for example traces.
- No padding, disclaimers, or meta-commentary.
